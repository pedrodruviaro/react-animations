    > _yarn install_ or _npm install_ then _yarn start_ or _npm start_

-   The see only the animation CSS go to **src/styles/animations.css**

-   The animations are made with CSS classes, placed directly on the components where we want to apply

-   The components are made with styled-components. Feel free to change and test new things!
