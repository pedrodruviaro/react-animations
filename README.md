# Simple React animations using CSS only

-   To test this, clone this repo and:
    > _yarn install_ or _npm install_ then _yarn start_ or _npm start_

---

-   To see only the animation code CSS go to **src/styles/animations.css** or just scroll down this page.

-   The animations are made with CSS classes, placed directly on the components where we want to apply.

-   Components are made with styled-components ðŸ’…. Feel free to change and test new things!
